In this project, I analyzed a cleaned dataset of threatened species sourced from the United Nations open data portal. The objective was to explore biodiversity loss trends across various countries and species types over time. I performed data preprocessing such as handling missing values, feature engineering (adding a “Decade” column), and encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding. The prepared data was used to train an XGBoost regression model to predict the number of threatened species based on country, species type, and temporal indicators.

To evaluate model performance, I used R² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the key metrics. Additionally, I created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib to highlight trends by decade and geographic distribution. The machine learning pipeline was constructed using scikit-learn and xgboost, with a focus on modular design for ease of tuning and experimentation. The goal was to identify vulnerable regions and species groups using data-driven insights that can support global conservation efforts.
