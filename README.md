This project explores global patterns of biodiversity loss by analyzing a dataset from the United Nations Statistical Division (UNData), which contains information on the number of threatened species by country, year, and species type. The raw data was cleaned and prepared using a Python script (data_wrangling.py) where columns were renamed, missing values were handled, and data types were standardized. Additionally, a new feature called Decade was created to capture broader temporal trends. For data visualization, an interactive Jupyter notebook (plots.ipynb) was developed to highlight patterns in species threat levels across different countries and time periods. Visual tools such as choropleth maps and sunburst plots were used to effectively communicate the distribution and concentration of threatened species worldwide.

The predictive component of the project was implemented in modeling.py using an XGBoost regression model. The pipeline included preprocessing steps for encoding categorical variables and was optimized using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The goal of the model was to predict the number of threatened species based on inputs such as country, species type, and year. Model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. The final model achieved an MSE of approximately 3363.89 and an R² score of 0.822, indicating strong predictive accuracy. Feature importance and actual vs. predicted scatter plots were generated to provide insights into model behavior. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in supporting biodiversity research and informing conservation strategies.
