This project analyzes global trends in threatened species using a dataset sourced from the United Nations, containing information on species type, threat count, country, and year. After loading the raw data, we performed extensive cleaning which included handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and engineering new features such as a "Decade" field to capture long-term trends. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to identify species most affected and regions with alarming growth in threat counts. The cleaned data was then used to build a machine learning pipeline in `scikit-learn`, incorporating `OneHotEncoder` for categorical encoding, a `ColumnTransformer` for preprocessing, and an `XGBRegressor` from the `xgboost` package to model and predict threat levels based on country, year, and species type.

To validate the modelâ€™s performance, we split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluated the predictions using key metrics such as the RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The modeling pipeline was fine-tuned using GridSearchCV to identify the best combination of hyperparameters for the XGBRegressor. Beyond regression modeling, we applied clustering techniques to group countries based on their projected threat levels. This enabled us to detect regional patterns and outliers in species endangerment. To support spatial understanding, we generated geospatial heatmaps that highlighted biodiversity risk zones across different continents. The project structure follows a modular design, separating code for preprocessing, modeling, and visualization to maintain clarity and scalability.
